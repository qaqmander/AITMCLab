## Content

* Quiz3, about Quadratic Residue

## Tips

* Use 'from secret import flag' instead of 'flag = "flag{\*\*\*\*\*\*}"'. You should know that python file 'quiz3.py' can only be executed with a 'secret.py' under the same directory, in which we define 'flag=xxxxxx'. It necessary to touch your own secret.py file for debugging~ refer:https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/63143493
* You can find key.enc file, in which the cipher stored. Read quiz3.py for details. More about file i/o:https://www.runoob.com/python/file-methods.html
* Quiz3: I have secret.py, and define 'flag' in it. I execute quiz3.py with it but only cipher and quiz3.py are given. Please find out what happened and calculate flag~
* We WILL NOT go through any python grammar in lab any more. It WILL be harder and harder to follow the AITMCLab. GOOD LUCK.
